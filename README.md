🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction and Web Application Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for lung cancer risk prediction using demographic, behavioral, and clinical features. The best-performing model (Random Forest) is deployed through a Gradio web application for interactive screening.

🎯 Objectives
-Develop ML models for lung cancer prediction
-Handle class imbalance
-Compare Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM
-Deploy best model as web application

🧠 Models Used
1.Logistic Regression
2.Linear SVM
3.Random Forest ✅ (Best Performing)
4.Gradient Boosting
